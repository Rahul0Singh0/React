## Pure React code

## Setup react app from scratch step by step
1. create package.json file
   ``` bash
   npm init
   ```
2. install react and react-dom
   ``` bash
   npm install react react-dom
   ```
3. install required dependencies
   ``` bash
   npm install <dependencies>
   ```
Note : You can install dependencies like react-router-dom, axios, babel etc. as per your project requirements.

## setup by tools
1. create-react-app tool recommended by FB initial days
   ``` bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
2. based on next.js implementation recommended by official react site
   ``` bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-app
   ```
   It is a full stack framework, So problem of framework discussed for beginner
3. vite tool is fast
   ``` bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```
   vite is not tightly coupled with react vue or any others...
